# Customer Behaviour Analysis 📊

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behaviour to understand purchasing patterns, subscription trends, and revenue distribution across different customer segments.  
The project follows an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data cleaning to SQL-based analysis and interactive visualization.

The main objective is to extract **actionable business insights** and present them through a clean and interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized categorical columns such as Gender, Subscription Status, Category, and Shipping Type
- Performed basic feature engineering for better analysis
- Exported the cleaned dataset as:
customer_behaviour_cleaned.csv
---

### 2. Database Integration (PostgreSQL)
- Connected VS Code to PostgreSQL
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into a PostgreSQL database
- Used SQL for structured analysis and business problem-solving

---

### 3. SQL Analysis
SQL analysis was performed by answering **10 business-driven questions** using PostgreSQL.  
Concepts such as **CTEs, subqueries, window functions, and conditional aggregation** were used.

#### SQL Questions Covered
1. What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?
2. Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount?
3. Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
4. How do average purchase amounts compare between Standard and Express shipping?
5. Do subscribed customers spend more compared to non-subscribers?
6. Which products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
7. How can customers be segmented into New, Returning, and Loyal groups?
8. What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
9. Are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) more likely to subscribe?
10. What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

---

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
- Connected the cleaned CSV file to Tableau
- Built an interactive dashboard including:
- KPIs: Total Customers, Average Purchase Amount, Average Review Rating
- Subscription Status distribution
- Revenue by Category
- Sales and Revenue by Age Group
- Dynamic filters: Subscription Status, Gender, Category, Shipping Type
- Focused on clean layout, usability, and storytelling
- Published the dashboard on **Tableau Public**

---

## Key Insights
- Non-subscribers form the majority of customers, but subscribers show higher average spending
- Clothing and Accessories are the top revenue-generating categories
- Young Adults and Middle-aged customers contribute the highest revenue
- Shipping type influences customer purchasing behavior
- Repeat buyers are more likely to subscribe and generate consistent revenue

---

## 6. Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were derived:

- **Boost Subscriptions**  
Promote exclusive benefits and offers for subscribed customers to increase conversion.

- **Customer Loyalty Programs**  
Reward repeat buyers to move them into the *Loyal* customer segment.

- **Review Discount Policy**  
Balance discount strategies to boost sales while maintaining healthy profit margins.

- **Product Positioning**  
Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns.

- **Targeted Marketing**  
Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups and customers who prefer express shipping.
